This is the Express and Connect integration of GraphQL Server. Apollo Server is a community-maintained open-source GraphQL server that works with many Node.js HTTP server frameworks. [Read the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/). [Read the CHANGELOG.](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

```shell
npm install apollo-server-express
```

## Express

```js
const express = require('express');
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-express');

// Construct a schema, using GraphQL schema language
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;

// Provide resolver functions for your schema fields
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello world!',
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

const app = express();
server.applyMiddleware({ app });

app.listen({ port: 4000 }, () =>
  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`)
);
```

## Connect

```js
const connect = require('connect');
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-express');
const query = require('qs-middleware');

// Construct a schema, using GraphQL schema language
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;

// Provide resolver functions for your schema fields
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello world!',
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

const app = connect();
const path = '/graphql';

app.use(query());
server.applyMiddleware({ app, path });

app.listen({ port: 4000 }, () =>
  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`)
);
```

> Note: `qs-middleware` is only required if running outside of Meteor

## Principles

GraphQL Server is built with the following principles in mind:

* **By the community, for the community**: GraphQL Server's development is driven by the needs of developers
* **Simplicity**: by keeping things simple, GraphQL Server is easier to use, easier to contribute to, and more secure
* **Performance**: GraphQL Server is well-tested and production-ready - no modifications needed
